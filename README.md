#LEARNPLACE

##Introduction

Learnplace is a eLearning platform, complete with a CMS that's going to allow school admins to create and manage video courses. Since we want our students to pay a monthly subscription to be able to see our videos, we are also going to integrate with Stripe, which is going to help us manage the app's payments system.
